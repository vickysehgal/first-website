    A <strong>Blockchain</strong> is a type of
    <mark>distributed ledger technology (DLT)</mark> that
    <del>consist</del> consists of growing list of records, called blocks,
    that are securely linked together using cryptography.[1] [2] [3] [4] Each
    block contains a <ins>cryptographic</ins> hash of the previous block, a
    timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree,
    where data nodes are represented by leaves). The
    <ins>timestamp</ins> proves that the transaction data existed when the
    block was created. Since each block contains information about the
    previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data
    structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it.
    Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they
    are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively
    without altering all subsequent blocks. <br />
    <b>Blockchains</b> are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer
    network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively
    adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new
    transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since
    blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by
    design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine
    fault tolerance.[5]

    Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his
    1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted
    by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[11] Further work on a cryptographically
    secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott
    Stornetta.[4][12] They wanted to implement a system wherein document
    timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave
    Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its
    efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into
    one block.[4][13] Under their company Surety, their document certificate
    hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since
    1995.[14]
